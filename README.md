# Embedded Control Systems

This repository contains embedded control logic and validation approaches
developed for automotive and EV-related systems.

## Overview
The projects focus on designing control logic, validating system behavior,
and analyzing responses under different operating conditions.

## Projects Included
- Rain-aware smart wiper control system
- Adaptive headlamp and turn signal automation
- Sensor-based decision logic for automotive applications

## Key Concepts
- Embedded C programming (basic)
- Control logic design and implementation
- Functional testing and system validation
- Behavior analysis under varying conditions

## Tools & Platforms
- Embedded C
- Microcontroller-based systems
- MATLAB/Simulink (for logic verification and validation)

## Validation Approach
- Requirement-based testing
- Functional and behavioral validation
- Scenario-based analysis

## Status
Academic and research projects developed as part of M.Tech coursework
and IEEE-published work.
